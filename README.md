Package to deal with image meta-data, currently only supporting JPG files, reading
EXIF and IPTC. Native Go, no dependencies.

Note: Some parts of the implementation are still a bit rough, haven't had the time to polish and clean.
      Also this package is not fully completed and tests are obviously missing.
